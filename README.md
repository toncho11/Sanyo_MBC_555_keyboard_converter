# Sanyo MBC 555 keyboard converter
This is an Arduino code that converts keyboard scan codes transmitted over serial from one set of scan codes to another set. It is used in a Sanyo MBC 555 computer. The Arduino intercepts the original scan code from the keyboard's 8749 microcontroller and replaces it with a new one. Both the RX and TX pins arer used to receive and re-send the new scan code. It basically replaces replaces the serial communication between the keyboard's microcontroller and computer's internal serial UART microcontroller 8051.
